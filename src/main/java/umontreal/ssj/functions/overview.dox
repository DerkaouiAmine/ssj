 * @package umontreal.ssj.functions
 *
 * Univariate functions as Java objects.
 *
 * This package contains utility classes to represent univariate
 * mathematical functions. They are useful, for example, when we want to
 * pass such a function as argument to a method.
 * They permit one to apply mathematical operations such as squaring, power, etc. on
 * generic functions. There are also a few basic utilities for numerical differentiation
 * and integration.
